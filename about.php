			 <h4>Our Mission</h4>
			 <p>Today, booking the right tour or holiday package has become a time consuming and painful process. Which tour operator is qualified? Whatâ€™s the right tour price? When you pay an upfront deposit to an unknown tour operator, is your money safe? Are the reviews seen on a local operators website genuine?</p>

			 <h4>Safety Information</h4>
			 <p>Unwary tourists can make easy targets for thieves because they stand out in a crowd, are unused to their surroundings, and are generally carrying money, credit cards and valuables like cameras. You can reduce your risk of being mugged or robbed by taking a few simple precautions. It is a good idea to research the safety of your intended destination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This government department keeps an updated bulletin on travel destinations, covering factors such as political unrest or criminal activities that target tourists. You could also consult with your travel agent, or talk to friends who have already visited your intended destination.</p>
